Docker is a tool that packages applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that run consistently across environments. 
Docker Compose is a companion tool that lets you define and manage multi-container applications (e.g., API + database) using a simple YAML file. 
They are essential skills for developers because they solve the “works on my machine” problem, improve deployment consistency, and make collaboration easier. 
Building and running containers can be automated using CI/CD pipelines or orchestration tools like Kubernetes. 
To dockerize a Node.js API, you typically create a `Dockerfile` that installs dependencies, copies the code, and defines a start command, then build and run it using Docker. 
In short, Docker streamlines development, testing, and deployment, making applications more reliable and scalable across different environments.
