Linting is the process of automatically checking code for style issues, errors, or bad practices before it runs. 
Unit tests are small, focused tests that verify individual pieces of code (like functions) work as intended. 
Both are critical because they catch bugs early, enforce consistency, and build confidence in code quality. 
They can be automated through tools and CI/CD pipelines so checks run on every commit. 
In a Node.js API, linting is often done with tools like **ESLint**, while unit tests can be written with frameworks like **Jest** or **Mocha**. 
Flaky tests—those that sometimes pass and sometimes fail without code changes—can erode trust in the test suite and slow down development by causing confusion and wasted debugging time. 
In short, linting and testing bring discipline, reliability, and automation that help teams ship better software faster.
