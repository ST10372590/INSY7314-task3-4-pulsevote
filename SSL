SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols that encrypt data transmitted between a client and a server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. 
HTTPS is HTTP over SSL/TLS, meaning all communications are encrypted, while HTTP sends data in plain text. 
SSL is necessary for web applications to protect sensitive information like passwords, personal details, and payment data from being intercepted by attackers. 
Without SSL, data can be stolen, modified, or impersonated by malicious actors, leading to account breaches, identity theft, or financial loss. 
A real-world example is the 2019 Capital One breach, where misconfigured cloud resources and weak security controls exposed sensitive customer dataâ€”though not solely SSL-related, it highlights the risks of inadequate encryption and security practices. 
In short, SSL/TLS is a fundamental layer of security for maintaining trust and protecting users in web applications.
